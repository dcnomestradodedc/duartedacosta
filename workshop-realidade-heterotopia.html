      <p class="p1"> <span class="underline">An excerpt of the editorial written by João Pestana and I for the workshop and some other relevant aspects:</span>
      <br>
      «In the middle of our relationship with the world, in the middle of our relationship with all the things that surround us, and especially in the middle of our relationship with our own fabrications 
      and ideas, is <span class="destaques">the gaze</span>. From the moment we are born, our gaze becomes <span class="destaques">a kind of interlocutor</span> that is always present in the relationships we establish with the place we assume in the surrounding world. 
      <span class="destaques">'Seeing comes before words'</span>, like John Berger (1972) says in <span class="destaques2">Ways of Seeing</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">The way we see the world is, in a way, an <span class="destaques">image</span>. <span class="destaques">An image is a representation</span>—internal or external, mental or artefactual—<span class="destaques">of a gaze that can be both reproduced and recreated</span>. 
      When we talk about internal or mental representations, we are talking about dreams, imaginations and personal perceptions. In this sense, our brain is the core producer of internal representations which, in turn, 
      reacts to all external representations in the physical world. <span class="destaques">Therefore, we are image-makers</span>. 
      </p>

      <p class="p2">Based on these ideas, we are then ready to state that <span class="destaques">we, designers, are also image-makers</span>. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="p2">When we talk about images in the current state of contemporaneity, we certainly agree that the images we create today differ from those created ten, fifteen, twenty or more years ago—back then, 
      the rubrics under which images were inscribed were different. <span class="destaques">Today, everything is considered an image</span>. But what interests us here is <span class="destaques">the idea of returning 
      to a space where we produce our own images, based on our perception, our gaze and what was the essence of image production before the advent of the first photographic and film cameras </span>. 
      In other words, what interests us is the creation of images based on the analogue record of how we see something or someone, <span class="destaques">like a painting, a drawing, a sculpture</span>.»

      <p class="p2"><span class="destaques2"> Da Realidade à Heterotopia Visual: Exercícios sobre o que vemos, como vemos e as imagens que daí surgem (From Reality to Visual Heterotopia: Exercises on what we see, 
      how we see and the images that stem from it)</span> stemmed from the initial motivations listed above.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">First, we challenged the participants to create images of certain objects. These images had the same purpose and objective for each participant, but the images produced by each one were obviously 
      different, because <span class="destaques">each person's way of looking at the objects was different</span>, along with the intentions and criteria that each participant ended up defining to create the image. And basically, this is where the 
      concept of <span class="destaques2">visual</span> <span class="destaques">heterotopia</span> comes in.	
      </p>

      <p class="p2">According to Michel Foucault (1984), in <span class="destaques2">Of Other Spaces</span>, <span class="destaques">the heterotopia is a real but complex space, with several layers and marked by inverted relationships</span>. 
      Unlike a utopia, which would be an imaginary and non-existent space, the heterotopia that Foucault proposes is a kind of realised utopia: <span class="destaques">a space that represents and challenges reality, but does not abandon it</span>. 
      </p>

      <p class="p2">Basically, during the workshop, several images of a single object were generated, but <span class="destaques">they differ from one another because our individual way of looking at our surroundings is also different</span>.	
      Each image created of the same object is, in fact, a singular manifestation within a multiplicity of coexisting perceptions. <span class="destaques2">Visual</span> <span class="destaques">heterotopia</span> 
      is not just the alteration of an isolated perception, but <span class="destaques">the overlapping of different perceived realities that exist simultaneously</span>.

    <div class="text-block">
      <p class="p2">When we were defining concepts and ideas, we recognised that the ideas and concepts presented were dense and could appear somewhat complex, especially given the length of the workshop (around 3 hours).
      However, we wanted this workshop to differ from the typical exercises that are done in classrooms, simply because we wanted the participants to see the session as <span class="destaques">a space that valued 
      testing, trialing, risking and failing as valid methods of production and that moved away from the normative standards that only favour successful results and that predominate in academia</span>, like Paul Bailey (2023)
      says in <span class="destaques">«On disciplinarity and legibility, failure attempt»</span>. Any exercise carried out as part of this workshop should be seen as a practice in which there is a premise that allows 
      us to fail, yet still presenting the results from those fails and reflecting on them and their conclusions.
