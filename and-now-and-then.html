      <p class="p1">Our world is made up of stories, visions, fictions that we repeat to others, which we convince ourselves of and call truth. <span class="destaques">These make up a semi-consensual reality and filter it. 
        They deny some voices and aggravate others</span>. But let's look at these discourses, with design somewhere in between, to at least see some of their potential. 
        <span class="destaques">It is the uncomfortable, disruptive narratives offered by these discourses that show effective strategies for dealing with human identity</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">Understanding communication design as the result of a processual circuit that is dependent on multiple contexts, agents and voices, <span class="destaques2">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked: 
        O design entre o feminino, as margens e a ficção [And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked: Design between the feminine, the margins and fiction]</span> questions and diverts, seeks <span class="destaques">
        new modes of action that see design through its critical potential</span>, represents a discourse that shifts its impact to clearly creative spaces, <span class="destaques">as they are formed as alternatives to traditional logics</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">The project understands publishing, in all its aspects, as a space where voices converge, as a space that carries academically created narratives, their intersections and the discourse that emerges 
        from them. It understands the formation of this transversal discourse as <span class="destaques">a territory of circulation that expands and transgresses the limits of the academy where it was formed</span>. 
        But rather than representing closed projects, this process is governed by <span class="destaques">the intersections between the reflections they provoke and the voices that triggered their narratives</span>, 
        in an exchange that is never really finished. More specifically, we're talking about the reflections created by the final-year communication design students at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon in the 2021/2022 academic year. 
        It is under these assumptions, and others that have emerged from the production of these students, that we position our intentions. </span>

      <p class="p2">Like the narratives we carry, <span class="destaques2">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked...</span> seeks to <span class="destaques">(re)view design and the discourse that emerges from its logics through the lens of the feminine</span>. 
        It proposes to see the formation of this discourse as <span class="destaques">the creation of a counter-history</span>, as <span class="destaques">the reformulation of the canon and of our relationship with reality</span>. 
        The<span class="destaques"> lens of the feminine</span> opens up our field of vision and we see it as <span class="destaques">a transgression of the dominant discourses and the models for receiving this discourse</span>. 
        It is a rupture that takes us back to the project's title, which derives from Anneke Smelik's <span class="destaques2">And The Mirror Cracked</span> (1998), and to which we add a parenthesis 
        that <span class="destaques">binds us to reality and denounces its volatility</span>.

      <p class="p2">Assuming strangeness rather than plausibility, ambiguity rather than immutable meaning, experimentation rather than the canon, <span class="destaques">isn't the role of design to produce the alternative, 
        subversion and challenge dominant discourses, to change their focus and divert them</span>?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-block">
      <p class="p2">An important part of this project is the relational process that begins in <span class="destaques">subversion and counter-culture</span>, passes through <span class="destaques">feminist thought</span>
        and culminates in <span class="destaques">the practices of fiction and design</span>, perhaps never really ending. <span class="destaques">A process that itself seeks to generate counter-discourse and subvert narratives</span>. 
        It is by challenging the constraints of the counter-narrative and making it broader that we make room for <span class="destaques">the alternative</span>, <span class="destaques">for dreams and convictions that challenge the hegemonic discourse and finally break
        the mirror—this is where</span> <span class="destaques2">And (Now and Then) the Mirror Cracked...</span> <span class="destaques">positions design</span>.
